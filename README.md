#About the Project:

This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. In the first part, I used Python visualization libraries to systematically explore the selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. In the second part, I produced a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that I discovered in the selected dataset.

#About the Data Set: PISA Data

PISA is a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. It is not a conventional school test. Rather than examining how well students have learned the school curriculum, it looks at how well prepared they are for life beyond school.

Around 510,000 students in 65 economies took part in the PISA 2012 assessment of reading, mathematics and science representing about 28 million 15-year-olds globally. Of those economies, 44 took part in an assessment of creative problem solving and 18 in an assessment of financial literacy.

Details about the Survey Design can be found in the technical report: http://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/pisa2012technicalreport.html

#Research Insights:

Students Majority distribution across countries:
Mexico contains the most student who participated in the survey. Followed by Italy, Spain, Canada, and Brazil.

Scores distribution across students:
The performance distribution of Math Score, Reading Score and Science Score is normal. Therefore we can conclude that the PISA test has been conducted in a proper manner. Most students scored between 400 and 500 points.

Group work ratio across students:
More than half of the students do not have group work at school. Students sometimes have a couple of group work every month. The minority of the students have group work a couple of times a week.

Students Internet Usage outside of School:
The majority of the students use the internet every day or almost every day outside of school.

Family background distribution:
There are way more students having a homogeneous family background than having a heterogeneous family background in the PISA study. This might be a misleading factor in the further analysis.

Difference in scores between male and female students:
Gender does not seem to play a significant role in student performance. Though something interesting to observe is that male participants scored higher on average on Math and Science, whereas female participants scored higher on Reading.

Number of parents effect on the student's score:
If the student has a single parent then the performance of the student is notably decreased. Students have a higher score if they live without or with both parents.

Scores Correlation:
There is a relationship between all the performance categories, which makes us think that a student that is performing well in one category will also perform well in another category. They are therefore interdependent.

#Conclusion:

The student performance in the investigated data set seems to be influenced by location, gender and family background. As we discovered a relationship between Math, Reading and Science scores, such as a sample size difference of students with a heterogeneous and a homogeneous family background, the results would need further investigation though.
