# PISA Data Visualization

The project is divided into two parts; in the first part, I used Python visualization libraries to explore the dataset systematically. The second part involves creating a short presentation that highlights the interesting insights and trends that I discovered in the dataset.

## About the Data Set: PISA Data
The PISA dataset is a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. The survey assesses the students' preparedness for life beyond school, and around 510,000 students in 65 economies participated in the PISA 2012 assessment.

## Project Implementation
The project was implemented using Jupyter Notebook with the following Python libraries:

* Pandas for data manipulation and analysis 
* NumPy for numerical operations  
* Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

## Conclusion:
This project reveals that a student's performance in the PISA dataset is influenced by location, gender, and family background. The insights and trends discovered need further investigation for a more in-depth understanding.
